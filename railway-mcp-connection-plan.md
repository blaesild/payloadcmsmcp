# Plan for Connecting to Payload CMS MCP on Railway

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to connect to the Payload CMS MCP server deployed on Railway from both laptop and desktop environments. The goal is to establish a reliable connection to the MCP server and ensure it can be easily set up on multiple devices.

## 1. Update MCP Settings with Railway URL

The current MCP settings file has the Payload CMS 3.0 MCP server pointing to localhost:8080, but we need to update it to point to the Railway deployment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem0-memory": {
      "Transport Type": "URL",
      "url": "https://mem0-mcp-production.up.railway.app/sse"
    },
    "Payload CMS 3.0 MCP": {
      "Transport Type": "URL",
      "url": "https://payloadcmsmcp-production.up.railway.app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

This change will direct Roo to connect to the Railway deployment instead of trying to connect to a local server.

## 2. Test Railway Connection

After updating the MCP settings, we need to verify that Roo can successfully connect to the Railway deployment:

1. Restart Roo to apply the new settings
2. Try using one of the MCP tools to verify the connection is working
3. Check for any error messages in the Roo console

If there are connection issues, we'll need to:
- Verify the SSE endpoint is properly implemented in server.js
- Check Railway logs for any errors
- Ensure Redis is properly connected

## 3. Create Portable Configuration

To use the same configuration on both laptop and desktop:

1. Create a standardized MCP settings file that can be shared between devices
2. Document the setup process for easy replication
3. Consider creating a simple setup script that copies the MCP settings to the correct location

## 4. Test on Multiple Devices

1. Apply the configuration on both laptop and desktop
2. Verify the MCP tools are accessible from Roo on both devices
3. Troubleshoot any device-specific issues that may arise

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update MCP Settings

1. Edit the MCP settings file to use the Railway URL:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem0-memory": {
      "Transport Type": "URL",
      "url": "https://mem0-mcp-production.up.railway.app/sse"
    },
    "Payload CMS 3.0 MCP": {
      "Transport Type": "URL",
      "url": "https://payloadcmsmcp-production.up.railway.app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Roo to apply the new settings

### Step 2: Test the Connection

1. In Roo, try using one of the MCP tools:
```
Use the Payload CMS 3.0 MCP tool to validate a collection
```

2. Check Railway logs for connection information:
```bash
railway logs
```

### Step 3: Create Portable Configuration

1. Export the MCP settings file:
```bash
cp "../../AppData/Roaming/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json" ./mcp_settings_backup.json
```

2. Create a simple setup script:
```javascript
// setup-mcp.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const os = require('os');

// Determine the correct path based on OS
const mcpSettingsPath = path.join(
  os.platform() === 'win32' 
    ? path.join(process.env.APPDATA, 'Code', 'User', 'globalStorage', 'rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline', 'settings')
    : path.join(os.homedir(), '.config', 'Code', 'User', 'globalStorage', 'rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline', 'settings'),
  'mcp_settings.json'
);

// Create the directory if it doesn't exist
fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(mcpSettingsPath), { recursive: true });

// Copy the settings file
fs.copyFileSync('./mcp_settings_backup.json', mcpSettingsPath);

console.log(`MCP settings copied to ${mcpSettingsPath}`);
```

### Step 4: Test on Multiple Devices

1. On each device, run the setup script:
```bash
node setup-mcp.js
```

2. Restart Roo and verify the connection works

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Railway Logs
- Check Railway logs for any errors or connection issues
- Look for Redis connection messages and SSE initialization

### Roo Console
- Check the Roo console for any MCP connection errors
- Verify tool execution results

### Health Checks
- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify server status
- Check Redis connection status through logs

## Redis Configuration

The Redis connection is configured with the following URL in Railway:
```
REDIS_URL=redis://default:xxCZQdRbgXXeDKejbYIYmHkyCNACQHBz@redis.railway.internal:6379
```

This Redis instance is running on Railway and is connected to the Payload CMS MCP server.
